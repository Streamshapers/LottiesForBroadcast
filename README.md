# LottiesForBroadcast
These are templates you can use to test here: www.converter.streamshapers.com
They are entirely made in After Effects and exported as json/lottie with Bodymovin.
They can be used for broadcasting, livestreams, televisison, educational, inspiration, you name it.

After converting the files with the Streamshapers converter to HTML-Templates, you can place them inside CasparCGs Templatefolder and start using them.

I used:
- CasparCG Server 2.3.2
- After Effects 24.1.0
- Bodymovin 5.9.0

Can also provide my AE Project Files, just get in contact ❤️
