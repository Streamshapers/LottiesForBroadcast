# LottiesForBroadcast
LottieFiles that are to be used for broadcasting. Livestreams, televisison, educational, inspiration, you name it.
Other than that - the files starting with "Check-..." are meant to demonstrate which After Effects functions and expression are working as a Lottie in CasparCG.

The jsons were made in After Effects, then exported with Bodymovin as described in repository mentioned underneath.
Follow the instructions in that repo to create html templates that can be played with CasparCG.

I used:
- CasparCG Server 2.3.2
- After Effects 18.4.0
- Bodymovin 5.9.0

Can also provide my AE Project Files, just get in contact ❤️
